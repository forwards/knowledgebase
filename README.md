# Overview of Forwards

## What is Forwards?

Forwards is a taskforce actively working to improve diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in R Foundation related activities (R core, CRAN, useR!, etc).

We are organized as six sub-teams: 

 - **Community**: General outreach to help people from under-represented groups get into R and develop as useRs.
 - **Conferences**: Focusing on R Foundation conferences, liaising with organizers/program committee on policies and inclusion initiatives.
 - **On-ramps**: Creating paths for useRs to develop their skills and make contributions the R/BioConductor package ecosystem and/or R core.
 - **Social Media**: Posting to Twitter and/or Facebook, soliciting blog posts and publishing them, maintaining website.
 - **Surveys**: Running and analysing community surveys, packaging up data and tools and maintaining the Data page.
 - **Teaching**: Methodology, materials and workshops designed for under-represented groups.
 
The (co-)leads of each team form a core team that keeps that taskforce on track.

## Who can join Forwards?

Any R user or developer who wants to work on DEI initiatives can join Forwards.

## When can I join Forwards?

Members can join any time, but we make a particular effort to recruit new members each July (around the time of useR!), so that is the best time to join.

## How long am I signing up for?

We ask members to commit for a year (July - July). Each July we ask existing members if they would like to stay on, change roles, or step down.

## What am I signing up to do?

We ask members to join one of the sub-teams, as their main focus. Members can join in with activities of any sub-team, but are expected to at least keep up-to-date with the work of their own sub-team and contribute where they can.

For examples of the activities of the teams, see the [team project boards](https://github.com/orgs/forwards/projects) or the [issues on the cross-team task repo](https://github.com/forwards/tasks/issues).

You can also look at minutes of our past [core team meetings and slackathons](https://github.com/forwards/meetings-public).

## What is the time commitment?

We try to arrange tasks to fit in with the time members can offer, so this varies a lot from person to person.

However, members are encouraged to keep in touch on the Forwards Slack and to join in with the quarterly program of cross-team events:

 - Month 1: Americas/Asia-Pacific 1-2 hour business meeting
 - Month 2: Global event, spread over long weekend (still with plenty of free time). A dedicated weekend for us all to focus on the work of the taskforce, where we may organize talks, co-working sessions, etc.
 - Month 3: Europe/Africa/Middle East 1-2 hour business meeting.
 
The cross-team events are intended to keep momentum going across the taskforce, share news, build community and increase our awareness of DEI issues. 
 
Sub-teams are self-organizing and may have regular meetings, ad-hoc meetings, or organize via Slack/GitHub/email.

## What are the responsibilities of team (co-)leads?

We aim to have two co-leads of each sub-team, to keep the team on track. Co-leads co-ordinate with each other to 

 - Curate the team tasks (often tracked on the [tasks repo](https://github.com/forwards/tasks/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen), labelled by team). Prioritise tasks, assign folk to tasks, add milestones, add tasks. The [project boards](https://github.com/orgs/forwards/projects/2) are largely automated and help give a overview.
 - Give feedback to others, e.g. review pull requests, respond to suggestions. Try to help if folk get stuck.
 - Participate in the quarterly business meetings to provide a progress update for the team and keep abreast of what the rest of the taskforce is doing. Send an update by email if no co-leads can attend.
 - Participate as often as possible in the quarterly global event to encourage the team to keep engaged and help move tasks along.

All taskforce members have a say in what activities the taskforce works on, so co-leads are not expected to come up with all the ideas themselves. However, co-leads will 
typically be people with some experience on the taskforce/relevant experience from outside. The co-lead system provides an opportunity for aspiring co-leads to be mentored in the role.

## How do I join?

Please discuss with a member of the core team or contact rowforwards@gmail.com.

## What happens when I join?

A core team member will get you on-boarded to the Forwards Slack, GitHub and email contact lists. Depending on the team/number of people joining at once, you may be invited to a 1-to-1 meeting or a sub-team meeting to get you started. We're all volunteers, so do ask questions and explore the Slack/GitHub yourself to get stuck in!
